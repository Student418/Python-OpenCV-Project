There are 3 different open cv projects.
The first project is about detection of number of persons crossing a particular area.
In this project ,cap variable is used to capture images from the camera. 0 Index number shows that the camera is in-built system camera. If there is an extenal camera used for capturing images then index number must be changed accordingly. Haarcascade classifier is used to detect the face of a person. Captured images are converted into gray scale so that its processing can become easier. In gray scale, each pixcel represent certain intensity of light. Vertical_area is the variable that stores the coordinates of deciding line. Counter is the variable that stores how many persons have crossed the deciding line. At starting its value is set to zero. Whenever a person crosses the line there will increment of one in the counter variable. Pyttsx3 library is used to convert text to speech. So when first peron crosses the line, it speaks the word 'First'. When second person crosses the line, it speaks the word 'Second' and so on.........
